# CrowdGoesWild
CrowdGoesWild is a module for Foundry VTT that adds realtime player reactions to help GMs gauge their players' feelings about what's happening in the game, and help foster player engagement. 

After installing and enabling the module, you and your players will see an icon bar under the standard chat box:

Clicking one of these buttons will send a predefined reaction to everyone connected to the game world. While the module includes a default set of icons, GMs can modify the color, style, icon, and animation effect of each of these. To modify the reaction set, go into the module settings and click Configure Available Reactions to bring up the Reaction Setup window.

Each field has an info tooltip available for more information.

## Icons
CrowdGoesWild uses the [Font Awesome collection of icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) included with Foundry VTT, giving GMs access to more than 20,000 different icons. To change an icon, simply pick an icon from Font Awesome's extensive library, and copy/paste its name (without "fa-" in front) into the Icon field. CrowdGoesWild also has support for many of Font Awesome's different icon styles. The duotone icons look great with a secondary color selected.

## Presets
Several reaction set presets are included for different game types. To choose a preset, simply select it from the dropdown box and click "Load Preset" (there's a confirmation dialog, as well). If you put together a reaction set that you think should be included as a preset, submit an issue with a screenshot and exported JSON file. 

## Macros
You can also drag any of the reaction buttons from the chat-area bar to your macro hotbar and a macro will be created for that reaction. Currently, the macros can only trigger reactions by ID (i.e., if you create a macro for a reaction, then your GM changes the available reactions, your macro will trigger the new reaction in that slot). This is to allow GMs control over the available reactions, even sent via macro.

Dragging a button onto the macro bar will create a macro using a specific icon location. These icons can be regenerated by the GM after making changes to the icon set by clicking the "Generate Reaction PNGs" button in the reaction settings window. This will generate a new set of icons and force a page reload to display the new icons. 

## Vibe Check
GMs can now request a vibe check to see how the group is doing. Clicking the Vibe Check button will pop up a survey on each player's screen. When they select a response, it's sent back to the GM and displayed along with the player's name and portrait:
